### Machine Learning Foundations

[Boston Housing](https://github.com/zoeyzora987/MLND/tree/master/boston_housing)

This project introduces the basics of machine learning by predicting housing prices on the Boston Housing Dataset. Concepts covered include: train test split, cross validation, evaluation metrix, learning curves, complexity curves, bias-variance tradeoff, gridsearch cross validation, regression algorithms.

### Supervised Learning
[Finding Donors](https://github.com/zoeyzora987/MLND/tree/master/finding_donors)

This projects uses preprocessing and supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Concepts covered include: preprocessing (normalization, one-hot encoding), benchmarking, supervised learning algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors), Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression), evaluating models, feature importance.

### Unsupervised Learning
[Customer Segments](https://github.com/zoeyzora987/MLND/tree/master/customer_segments)
This projects uses unsupervised learning technique to uncover customer clusters. Concepts covered include: feature transformation (PCA), dimensionality reduction, clustering (K-Means, Gaussian Mixure Model), data recovery.

### Reinforcement Learning
[Smartcab](https://github.com/zoeyzora987/MLND/tree/master/smartcab)

This project uses Q-learning to train a cab to make the correct decisions while navigating busy intersections.

### Deep Learning
[dog-project](https://github.com/zoeyzora987/MLND/tree/master/dog-project)

This projects builds on a Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning to detect faces in images and then predict breeds of dogs from new pictures. The same algorithm was then adapted to predict which dog breeds a human looks like.
