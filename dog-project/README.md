### Dog Project

#### Setup
At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. 
If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. 
If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

##### Step 0: Import Datasets
##### Step 1: Detect Humans
##### Step 2: Detect Dogs
##### Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
##### Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
##### Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
##### Step 6: Write and Test Algorithm


#### Install
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
